## Mining
By using the `;mine` command, you mine your cave in the chance to recieve gold, equipment, or exp. Each cave drops different loot and has different odds to drop loot. Happy hour is 7 pm EST every day. During happy hour, players gain 2x exp for mining

## Caves
Each cave has a level requirement that is needed for someone to enter it. Every cave drops a set amount of exp. For example, the Beginner cave drops 1 exp per mine while the Dark Cave drops 10 exp per mine.\
Cave loot is seperated into 5 categories: Nothing, Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary\
Typically, the latter categories will have a lower chance to drop.\
Additionally, some caves can only be mined a certain amount. For example, if a cave only has 1,000 mines, it can no longer be mined when it is mined a total of 1000 times by all miners. The remaining mines in a cave gets reset periodically. Some caves, however, can be mined an infinite amount of times.\
If you're interested in viewing all available caves, you can find them [here](https://github.com/kanedu828/Isla-Bot-2.0/blob/master/data/caves.py).
If you understand the cave list in that file and you would like to help out, feel free to list the caves in a readable format here with a pull request!

## Equipment
You can find various equipment while mining. There are 6 different types of equipment: Helmet, vest, pants, gloves, pickaxe, and boots.\
Each equipment gives you stats and it is totaled into your total stats, which you can see with ;stats.\
Some equipment also have set bonuses. If you have a certain amount of equipment equipped from that set, you will gain bonuses.\
There are two ways you can upgrade your equipment.
1. Star level: You gain a star for each duplicate equipment you have. Increasing your star level only increases the equipment's base stats. For example, if an equipment only has power and speed base stats, only power and speed will be upgraded. The first 5 stars give + 1 to each stat per star, the next 5 stars give +2, and so on.
2. Bonus: You can roll for bonuses with the ;bonus <equipment name> command. You will randomly get random stats. You can recieve up to 5 bonuses for a piece of equipment. Refer to the bonus section for more information.\


## Stats
Current there are four different stats for a user: power, speed, exp, luck\
Power: You get x amount of extra gold each time you mine gold.\
Speed: Cooldown for mining reduced. Max cooldown is 3 seconds, which is around 350 speed. (This stat will most likely be nerfed)\
Exp: You get x amount of extra exp each time you mine exp.\
Luck: Your chances of recieving Epic or Legendary loot is increased.\
Crit: Increase chance to crit while mining, which provides 2x exp.\
Your stats can be added raw (+) or added as a percentage (%).\
For example, if you have power + 6, you will get 6 power to your total power stat. If you have over 6%, you will get an additional 6% of your total power added to your total power.
Your total amount of stats is determined by all of your equipped equipment.\

## Bonus
You can give your equipment bonus stats through the `;bonus <equipment name>` command. This will cost 1000 gold.\
Currently you can recieve up to 5 bonus stats. When you first bonus your equipment, you will start off with one bonus. However, if you continue to bonus your equipment, you will reroll your bonuses with the chance to recieve another bonus.\
Here are the odds for getting extra bonuses:\
0 -> 1 bonus stats: 100%\
1 -> 2 bonus stats: 10%\
2 -> 3 bonus stats: 5%\
3 -> 4 bonus stats: 2.5%\
4 -> 5 bonus stats: 1%\
Additionally, the higher level your equipment, the better bonuses it will get.
  
## Blessings
After you reach level 50, you have the opportunity to reset your exp to gain blessings. Every 5 levels after level 50 will give you 1 blessing on a reset. Each blessing will permanently give you 1% exp to your stats.\
For example, if you have level 65, you will gain 3 blessings. If you are level 100, you will gain 10 blessings.
